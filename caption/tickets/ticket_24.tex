% Ticket #24 "Garbage in documents after recent TL2015 upgrade"
% https://sourceforge.net/p/latex-caption/tickets/24/

% Last September 18 I did a TL2015 upgrade and rebuilt my documents. Now they show garbage in List of Figures/Tables.
% This didn't occurred with the upgrade (and rebuild) I did on September 02. The following test case shows the issue:

\documentclass{book}

%%  Comment out this and garbage goes away
%%
%% We need to write :
%%
%%   cochranATieee.org
%%   sdcATcs.cmu.edu
%%
\usepackage{subfig}

\begin{document}
\frontmatter
%%
\listoffigures
\listoftables
%%
\mainmatter
%%
\chapter{A chapter}

\section{A section}

See the following figure

\begin{figure}
  \caption{Progresses in Science}
\end{figure}

\section{Another section}

See the following table

%%
\begin{table}
  \caption{Matter Fields}
\end{table}

Bye bye
%%
%%
\backmatter
\end{document}

(I compiled it with latexmk -pdf). When I comment out the line

\usepackage{subfig}

the garbage goes away.

Initially I suspected the the culprit was in subfig package but it has not been updated recently, instead caption package (loaded by subfig) was updated on Sept. 18.
